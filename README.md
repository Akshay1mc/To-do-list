# To-Do List (C++)

This is a simple console-based To-Do List application built in C++. It allows users to efficiently manage daily tasks through a menu-driven interface.

## Features
- **Add Task:** Input and save new tasks.
- **View Tasks:** Display all tasks with their status (Pending/Completed).
- **Mark as Completed:** Update a task’s status.
- **Remove Task:** Delete tasks from the list.
- **Exit:** Close the program safely.

## How It Works
The program stores tasks using a structure containing a task name and its completion status. Users interact through numbered menu options to perform each operation.

## Requirements
- Any C++ compiler (GCC, MinGW, Clang, Turbo C++).
- Can be run on any online compiler.

## How to Run
1. Copy the C++ program into your compiler.
2. Compile and execute.
3. Use the menu to manage tasks.
